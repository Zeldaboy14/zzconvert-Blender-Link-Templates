Thanks for choosing this optamized file. It's compatible with ZZPlayas (ofc) and has alot of equipment you'd find in Majoras Mask, ported
and ready to be used in your very own play-as! I couldn't have done this without the help of Saguinetti, whos optamized files were the 
beginning template, and Aria for some early testing!
