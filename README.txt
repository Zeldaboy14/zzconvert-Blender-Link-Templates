Thanks for choosing this optamized file. It's compatible with ZZPlayas and Z64playas and has alot of equipment you'd find in Majoras Mask, ported
and ready to be used in your very own play-as! I couldn't have done this without the help of Saguinetti, whos optimized files were the 
beginning template, Aria for some early testing, and Z64me for assisting in correcting the models to not overwrite links tunic color in OOT!
